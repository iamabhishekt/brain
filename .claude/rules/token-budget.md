# Token budget (always on)

- **Search:** grep first; read one file unless parallel is clearly needed.
- **Scope:** max 5 files per phase; no Task/subagents unless user asks or task spans many dirs.
- **Output:** short answers; no unsolicited docs/README; no repeating the plan.
- **Model:** default/composer unless user asks for max/thinking; no max mode by default.
- **Tools:** skip MCP unless the task needs that service; no exploratory repo-wide scans.
- **Edits:** minimal diff only; don't refactor unrelated code.
